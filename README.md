# supervised-learning-challenge

This project uses supervised learning to model and predict loan default risk.  
The training data was 2019 full year loan data.  
The testing data was 2020 Q1 loan data.    

The initial analysis compared logistic regression modeling with random forest classification modeling to determine the best method of prediction.
The data for the initial analysis was not scaled.  

The second analysis again compared logistic regression with random forest, but this time the data is scaled.    

The results are compared to determine the best modeling method with unscaled and scaled data.
